/**
 * A collection where the next value can be obtained at Random.
 *
 * <p>The way this works is that each item has a weight. Everytime an item is
 * added to the collection, the weight is added to the total weight value of the collection.
 * When the {@link #next()} method is called is calculates the probability of each item by
 * the weight/total_weight.</p>
 *
 * <p>So if one item has a weight of 10 and another of 20, the total weight is 30. The first item has a
 * 33% chance of being selected while the second item has a 66% of spawning. If a third item is added with a weight
 * of 5, these would be the probability table:</p>
 * <table>
 *     <caption></caption>
 *     <tr>
 *         <th>Item One</th>
 *         <th>Item Two</th>
 *         <th>Item Three</th>
 *         <th>Total Weight</th>
 *     </tr>
 *     <tr>
 *         <td>10/35 = 28.6%</td>
 *         <td>20/35 = 57.7%</td>
 *         <td>5/35 = 16.7%</td>
 *         <td>35</td>
 *     </tr>
 * </table>
 *
 * @param <E> The type of collection.
